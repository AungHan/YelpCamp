UPDATE
DELETE

RESTFUL ROUTES

Name		Path		HTTP Verb	Purpose
==============================================================================
Index		/dogs		    GET		list all dogs
New		    /dogs/new	    GET		show new dog form
Create		/dogs		    POST	create new dog and redirect
Show		/dogs/:id	    GET		show info about specific dog
Edit		/dogs/:id/edit	GET		show edit form for one dog
Update		/dogs/:id	    PUT		update particular dog, redirect
Destroy		/dogs/:id	    DELETE	delete particular dog

- method-override package allows overriding HTTP verb in form action path
